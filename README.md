## Notes

Thanks to [nvim-treesitter-context](https://github.com/romgrk/nvim-treesitter-context) which I based the lua windowing that this plugin uses.

The idea behind this project is based on [vim-sluice](https://github.com/dsummersl/vim-sluice) -- a buggier and more feature-ful version of this plugin for vim/gvim.
